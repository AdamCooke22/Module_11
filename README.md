# MODULE 10 CHALLENGE : Crypto Investments



---

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Pandas](https://github.com/google/pandas) - Pandas is a powerfull tool for data analysis and manipulation. Pandas provides a plethora of useful functions that make it easy to express, analyze, and manipulate data.

* [Hvplot](https://github.com/google/hvplot) - This Module provides a high-level potting API that allows for users to easily generate a wide array of plot types. HvPlot's main benefit is that it allows for very interactive visualizations.

* [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) - Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.

## Usage

To use the Crypto Clustering application file simply clone the repository and open the forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb file in google colab.

Upon opening the file you will have the option to run the whole note book and that will provide you with all of the calculations, evaluations, and visualizations for the analysis of the forecasting data. Some screenshots of that in action can be seen below via this link
